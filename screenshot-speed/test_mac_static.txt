Note: Mac has a Retina display, which means the displayed resolution is doubled from
the *virtual* resolution. That is, for all intents and purposes, treat a 2800 x 1800
Mac screen as 1400 x 900. (The retina part is ONLY for making the display look better.)

Virtual = Normal resolution, Retina = Double resolution
Both screenshot libraries use virtual resolution to specify the desired region to grab.
Then they used different methods to handle the retina resolution:

Pillow - If no region is specified, Pillow uses (0, 0, retina width, retina height).
First, Pillow uses screencapture (Mac commandline tool) to grab the *virtual resolution* region
of the screen, returning that region in *retina resolution*. Then, Pillow resizes that image into
the specified region size, and returns it. All in all, you specify a virtual res size, and Pillow
returns an image of that virtual res size. But if you don't specify a region, a retina res version
of the screen is returned.

MSS - If no region is specified, MSS uses (0, 0, virtual width, virtual height).
Luckily, MSS is straightforward. Query a virtual res region, and the returned image will be retina res.

Basically, just use MSS. I'm just noting down the technical details here for completeness's sake.
