## Linux

I'm going to generalize Mac results to Linux, since a brief search yielded no methods that were advertised as "fast". Suggesting that [MSS](https://github.com/BoboTiG/python-mss) is likely still the best choice.

## Remarks

This article was written in February 2023. There could be better tools out there now. And I'm pretty sure the Linux generalization is probably wrong. If there are any new tools (or ones I missed), I'd love to hear about it!
